## Module 14 - Interactive Visualization Challenge
In this assignment, we built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The findings are presented in the form of an ineractive dashboard with a Bar Graph, Bubble chart and Gauge that correspond to a selection of Test Subject ID (Test person) that can be made from a drop down menu. The demographic info for the Test Subject ID is also displayed on the dashboard.
